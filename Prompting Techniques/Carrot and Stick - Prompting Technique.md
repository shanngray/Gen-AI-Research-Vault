# Carrot and Stick - Prompting Technique

By telling an LLM that if it helps the user something good will occur, but if it is not helpful something bad will occur, we can influence the LLM to be more helpful.

Probably not the best technique to used if making shit up now that many OOTB models are introducing memory.
