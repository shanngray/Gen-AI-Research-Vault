#Softmax Function

## Explanation generated by GPT4o
The softmax function is a mathematical function often used in machine learning, particularly in classification problems and neural networks. It takes a vector of values (which could be positive, negative, or zero) and transforms them into a probability distribution, where the probabilities of each element are proportional to the exponentials of the input numbers.

Here’s how it works step-by-step:

### Formula:

For a vector $\mathbf{z} = [z_1, z_2, …, z_n]$, the softmax function calculates the probability for each $z_i$ as:


$$\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{z_j}}$$


### Explanation:
1.	**Exponentiation**: Each element $z_i$ is exponentiated using the natural exponential function $e^{z_i}$. This step ensures that all outputs are positive, even if the original $z_i$ values were negative.

2.	**Normalization**: The sum of all exponentials $\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{z_j}$ is used to normalize the values. Each exponentiated value $e^{z_i}$ is divided by this sum, ensuring that the output values sum to 1, making it a valid probability distribution.

3.	**Probabilistic Interpretation**: After applying softmax, each transformed value represents the probability of a certain class. The larger an input value $z_i$, the higher its corresponding probability will be relative to others.

### Use in Neural Networks:

In neural networks, softmax is typically used in the output layer for multi-class classification tasks. If the network is predicting which class an input belongs to, softmax ensures that the output values represent probabilities for each class, with all probabilities summing to 100%.

### Example:

Suppose you have three logits (raw prediction scores from a model): $z = [2.0, 1.0, 0.1]$. Applying the softmax function:

	1.	Exponentiate each value:

   $e^{2.0} \approx 7.39, \quad e^{1.0} \approx 2.71, \quad e^{0.1} \approx 1.11$

	2.	Sum of exponentials:

   $7.39 + 2.71 + 1.11 = 11.21$

	3.	Normalize:

   $\frac{7.39}{11.21} \approx 0.66, \quad \frac{2.71}{11.21} \approx 0.24, \quad \frac{1.11}{11.21} \approx 0.10$

So, after applying softmax, the vector $z = [2.0, 1.0, 0.1]$ becomes a probability distribution $[0.66, 0.24, 0.10]$, indicating that the first class is the most likely.

### Key Properties:
- **Range**: The softmax outputs are always in the range [0, 1].
- **Sum to 1**: The output values always sum to 1, making it a proper probability distribution.
- **Sensitive to relative values**: If one value is much larger than the others, it will dominate the output probabilities.

Softmax is crucial in tasks like language modeling, where models need to predict the next token in a sequence, and each token’s likelihood is based on the softmax-transformed scores.
